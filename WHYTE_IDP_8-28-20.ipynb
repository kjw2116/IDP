    "## *I am an obesity researcher who studies determinants of energy expenditure, energy intake and body composition in the United States.  My previous research focused on innovative energy expenditure methodology and most recently, ultra-processed food in maternal dietary intake and its impact on neonatal body composition.   My short-term objective is to expand my skills in intervention design and analyses and to develop expertise in body composition assessments. My long-term goal is to hold a tenure-track faculty position at a leading research institution so that I can independently conduct interdisciplinary, methodologically advanced and translational research with the goal of refining body composition and energy expenditure methodology and improving the health and livelihood of families and individuals with obesity.*"
